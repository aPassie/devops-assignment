| [02-vpc-project/](02-vpc-project/) | VPC, two public subnets across two AZs, internet gateway, route table, security group and an optional EC2 web server; planned, applied, verified with the AWS CLI, changed and destroyed |

Built on the Terraform notes and S3 demo in [Terraform Basics](../Terraform%20Basics/). Run
